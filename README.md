# Teikei

A web application for managing groups and farmers following the idea of [community-supported agriculture (CSA)][csa]. The framework is used for the [Ernte teilen][ernteteilen] website which is shown in the screenshot.

## Getting started

The framework consists of two components: the API back-end and the front-end. The back-end is based on [Ruby on Rails][rubyonrails]. Data is exchanged as JSON. The front-end is built with the help of [Marionette.js][marionettejs] and [Backbone.js][backbonejs]. The website is designed to work as a single-page-application, at least for the major parts of the interface.

### Settings

* You need to create an `.env` file which contains the environment variables needed to run the project. The included `.env.sample` file lists the variables which need to be set.

### Test data

* A superadmin account can be generated by running `rake db:seed`.
* Test data in general (users, farms, depots, faqs) can be generated by running `rake db:seed:generate`.
* The task `rake db:seed:all` runs both tasks mentioned before.

## Roadmap

We use [Trello][trello] to plan upcoming features. Our project there is not public yet.

## Known issues

On Ubuntu there might be an issue running `bundle install`. There is a dependency for `libcrypto.so.0.9.8`. To circumvend the problem install `libssl0.9.8`.
